1. Turn on wireless router.

2a) On emission capturing machine, start chronyd
2b) Check that chronyd is running and port 123 is open

3.  connect emission capturing machine to the wireless router.

4. Turn on RPi, with keyboard connected. It should connect to wireless router automatically

5. From emission capturing machine, check the IP address of RPi and ssh in.

6a) Check the keyboard capturing device on the RPi (/dev/input/event?) and modify /etc/chrony.conf accordingly
6b) Start chronyd on RPi and check that time is synced.
6c) Run the getkeypress*.py script and ensure that keypresses are captured.

7a) On the emission capturing machine, start SpyServer, with SpyVerter activated.
7b) Check on SDR# and GNURadio that 0-8MHz is captured correctly and keypresses are visible



Getting data
============
1. Run getkeypress*.py on the RPi with root privileges
2. Run the GNURadio capture flowgraph
3. Press keys
4. Stop the GNURadio flowgraph
5. Stop the getkeypress*.py on RPi, save output to a file and copy the file over for analysis
6. Save IQ data and the keypress output in a directory for later analysis. Capture the timestamp IQ data file.
