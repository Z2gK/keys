There is an option in GNU Radio Meta File Sink to detach the metadata information from the raw data - this is probably preferred.

But looking at the dump from different times, the metadata seems to stay constant..

The parse_header function takes in a PMT dictionary - could we simply pass the 150 byte blob into the function?
