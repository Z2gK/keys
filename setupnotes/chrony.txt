Server
======
* Configuring chrony
Edit the /etc/chrony.conf file by uncommenting/editing the following lines:


driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift

allow 192.168.??/24     # Replace this with the range allowed to connect to the server

local stratum 10



* Configuring iptables
These need to be run once with root privileges

iptables -N UDP
iptables -A UDP -p udp -m udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules

Then, start the firewall service
systemctl start iptables.service

Start chronyd as well
systemctl start chronyd


Client
======
* Configuring chrony
Edit the /etc/chrony.conf file by uncommenting/editing the following lines:

driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
server <Server-IP> iburst iburst  # Unfortunately, since we don't use DNS and we're on DHCP, we need to manually edit this everytime
logdir /var/log/chrony
log measurements statistics tracking
makestep 1.0 -1       # This is important if the client is way out of sync - "1.0" is in units of seconds. If the time difference is greater than this number, chrony will make "-1" number of corrections. If this is set to -1, chrony makes an indefinite number of corrections until it is correct. 

Start the service:
systemctl start chronyd
